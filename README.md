# If you are here

## 🎮 Project Overview
This is a 2-week long school project where we developed a shoot 'em up game using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). It served as the final project for our first semester of our first year in [G.Tech](https://gamingcampus.fr/ecoles/ecole-developpeur-jeux-video-g-tech.html).
The gimmick of our game, *If you are here*, is that you control **two** characters instead of one. You can swap between one or the other, allowing you to avoid attacks that you may not have been able to do otherwise.
